## Overview

AstroPile is an ambitious open-source, open-data initiative aimed at revolutionizing the way we handle astronomical data. Our goal is to compile a large-scale, machine learning-ready dataset of multi-survey, multi-modality observational astronomical data. By mimicking the web-scale image and language datasets prevalent in computer science, we tailor our approach to meet the unique challenges and opportunities of astrophysical problems.
